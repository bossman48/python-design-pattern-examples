"""
Prototype Method is a Creational Design Pattern which aims to reduce the number of classes used for an application. 
It allows you to copy existing objects independent of the concrete implementation of their classes. Generally, here the object is created by copying a prototypical instance during run-time. 

sIt is highly recommended to use Prototype Method when the object creation is an expensive task in terms of time and usage of resources and already there exists a similar object. 
This method provides a way to copy the original object and then modify it according to our needs.
"""

"""
Advantages

Less number of SubClasses : All the other Creational Design Patterns provides a lot of new subClasses which are definitely not easy to handle when we are working on a large project. But using Prototype Design Pattern, we get rid of this.
Provides varying values to new objects: All the highly dynamic systems allows you to define new behavior through object composition by specifying values for an objectâ€™s variables and not by defining new classes.
Provides varying structure to new objects: Generally all the applications build objects from parts and subparts. For convenience, such applications often allows you instantiate complex, user-defined structures to use a specific subcircuit again and again.

Disadvantages

Abstraction: It helps in achieving the abstraction by hiding the concrete implementation details of the class.
Waste of resources at lower level: It might be proved as the overkill of resources for a project that uses very few objects
