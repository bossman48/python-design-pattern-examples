"""

Chain of Responsibility method is Behavioral design pattern and it is the object-oriented version of if … elif … elif … else and make us capable to rearrange the condition-action blocks dynamically at the run-time. It allows us to pass the requests along the chain of handlers. The processing is simple, whenever any handler received the request it has two choices either to process it or pass it to the next handler in the chain. 
This pattern aims to decouple the senders of a request from its receivers by allowing the request to move through chained receivers until it is handled. 

"""

"""
Advantages

 

Single Responsibility Principle: It’s easy to decouple the classes here that invoke operations from classes that perform operations.
Open/Closed principle: We can introduce the new code classes without breaking th existing client code.
Increases Flexibility: While giving the responsibilities to the objects, it increases the flexibility of the code.
 

Disadvantages

 

Unassured about request: This method doesn’t provide any assurance whether the object will be received or not.
Spotting characteristics: Due to debugging, it becomes difficult task to observe the characteristics of operations.
Depreciated System Performance: It might affect the system’s performance due to continuous cycle calls
 

Applicability

 

Processing several handlers in order: Chain of responsibility method helps very much when it is required to process several handlers in a particular order because the linking is possible in any order
Decoupling requests: This method is generally used when you want to decouple the request’s sender and receiver.
Unspecified handlers: When you don’t want to specify handlers in the code, it is always preferred to use the Chain of Responsibility.
