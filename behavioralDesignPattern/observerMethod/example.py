"""
The observer method is a Behavioral design Pattern which allows you to define or create a subscription mechanism to send the notification to the multiple objects about any new event that happens to the object that they are observing. The subject is basically observed by multiple objects. The subject needs to be monitored and whenever there is a change in the subject, the observers are being notified about the change. This pattern defines one to Many dependencies between objects so that one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

"""

"""
Advantages

 

Open/Closed Principle: Introducing subscriber classes is much easier in Observer method as compared to others without making changes in the clientâ€™s code.
Establishes Relationships: Its really easy to establishes the relationships at the runtime between the objects.
Description: It carefully describes about the coupling present between the objects and the observer. Hence, there is no need to modify Subject to add or remove observers.
 

Disadvantages

 

Memory Leakage: Memory leaks caused by Lapsed Listener Problem because of explicit register and unregistering of observers.
Random Notifications: All the subscribers present gets notification in the random order.
Risky Implementations: If the pattern is not implemented carefully, there are huge chances that you will end up with large complexity code.
 

Applicability

 

Multi-Dependency: We should use this pattern when multiple objects are dependent on the state of one object as it provides a neat and well tested design for the same.
Getting Notifications: It is used in social media, RSS feeds, email subscription in which you have the option to follow or subscribe and you receive latest notification.
Reflections of Object: When we do not coupled the objects tightly, then the change of a state in one object must be reflected in another object.
